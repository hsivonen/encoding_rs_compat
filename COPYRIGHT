Summary:

Release builds that omit tests are available under the MIT license (see
LICENSE.txt).

Details:

encoding_rs_compat is a fork of rust-encoding.

The original rust-encoding is under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt) with
the copyright notice:
Copyright (c) 2013, Kang Seonghoon.

The modifications to rust-encoding are Copyright 2013-2016 Mozilla Foundation
and are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 <LICENSE-APACHE or
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> or the MIT license <LICENSE.txt or
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>, at your option. Contributions to
encoding_rs_compat must be MIT/Apache 2.0 dual-licensed; see CONTRIBUTING.md.

The upstream rust-encoding is in the process of being retroactively relicensed
under MIT or Apache License, Version 2.0 at the recipient's option; see
https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-encoding/issues/93 . However, the
relicensing hasn't been completed yet. Once the upstream relicensing is
complete or it is determined that the code that hasn't been relicensed has
been deleted from encoding_rs_compat, encoding_rs_compat as a whole can become
dual-licensed.
